# Headout_VideoSharing

Brainstorming is the first step to do before you get on with a project.

One of the main success of a product comes from rememberance.

First Step for Success:

> Creating a visual symbol that represents your Product. Some logos have powerful symbolic association connected to people's memory.

> Hey! Do you know Dailymotion? Yahhhh!!! Thats right? I dont think you can remember them , it is because you dont remember their logos.

Since it is a mockup project I came up with a name and logo. ( Just a placeholder , dont hold a grudge if it doesnt suit your taste)

### Name: ShareVeo
### Logo : ( We will see in the Landing page :D )

While developing the frontpage , I would like to mix the approach of a new upcoming site and also a much established one.
( Tiktok and Youtube). Tiktok is a video sharing site. TikTok has a basic landing page that allows users to know what they are signing up for. As an upcoming site, People will be feel more comfortable to use the previously existing environment and we should smoothen them into ours.

Since I am going for a *Single Page* Demonstration , I would like to fit Tiktok's Landing Page with that of some Trending videos. I will explain the flow of my Design as and when possible.

The First View for the user asks him to explore / Join the Network if he scrolls down it means that he didnt buy it , so the next step is the show him some of the hottest video and pursuade him to explore more thats what the first page is for.

### Framework Used: ReactJs: Easier to organise and containerize components.

The Site is yet to be made mobile responsive, as it is just a minimal implementation of the mockup.
