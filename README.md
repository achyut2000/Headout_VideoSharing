Brainstorming is the first step to do before you get on with a project.

One of the main success of a product comes from rememberance.

First Step for Success:

> Creating a visual symbol that represents your Product. Some logos have powerful symbolic association connected to people's memory.

> Hey! Do you know Dailymotion? Yahhhh!!! Thats right? I dont think you can remember them , it is because you dont remember their logos.

Since it is a mockup project I came up with a name and logo. ( Just a placeholder , dont hold a grudge if it doesnt suit your taste)

### Name: ShareVeo
### Logo : ( We will see in the Landing page :D )
